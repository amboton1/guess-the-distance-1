# Guess The Distance

## Project setup

For this project we will be using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) for frontend
and [Express](https://expressjs.com) NodeJs framework for backend

### Your task is following:

1) Within project directory create separate directories for backend and frontend.

2) In both directories initialize npm by running ```npm init```

3. In the frontend directory create a new React application by using CRA (Create React App) package

4. Clean unnecessary stuff that CRA created by default (component, styles, tests etc.)

5. Within backend directory install express package and create basic server that listens on port 8000

    5.1. Make sure that you don't hardocde the port, but rather pull it from either config file or ```.env``` file
